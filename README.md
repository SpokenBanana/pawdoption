# Pawdoption

This app helps you find your next pet from local animal shelters!
Swipe through pets in a Tinder like interface to search for your next pet.
Swipring right will save the pet to your saved list for later viewing.

All pets have information such as age, breed, biograph and which shelter
they are located in! It gives you the contact and general information 
necessary to adopt the pet.

Pawdoption allows you to choose between swiping through dogs or cats.
(Option for both coming soon!)

# Development details

## The Pet API

All pet information was gathered through the [PetFinder](http://www.petfinder.com) API. 

NOTE: Petfinder no longer returns full pet descriptions in their API which
made profiles much less useful. Looking for an alternative.
